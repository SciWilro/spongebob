### CRAN Response

> Thanks, and why do we need this on CRAN?

Our response: 

> Thank you for reviewing my package. This is a lightweight package simply for fun -- similar in spirit to other packages on CRAN like [cowsay](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cowsay) and [happytime](https://cran.r-project.org/package=happytime).
